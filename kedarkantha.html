    <h2>My Journey</h2>
    <p>
      Kedarkantha is one of the most thrilling winter treks in India, nestled in the Himalayas at an altitude of 12,500 ft.
      As a Person with Disability (PWD), this trek wasn’t just about climbing a mountain — it was about climbing beyond limitations. 
      It became a personal mission to prove to myself, and to others, that no physical barrier is bigger than the strength of the human spirit.

    <h2>A moment Etched in Time</h2>  
  <p>
    On 11th February 2025 at exactly 7:10 AM, I stood at the summit of Kedarkantha, surrounded by snow-covered peaks, crisp mountain air, and the most breathtaking sunrise I’ve ever witnessed.
    That moment was not just a picture-perfect frame — it was a snapshot of courage, persistence, and triumph.
    I remember the silence. No noise, no distractions — just the whisper of wind and the crackle of snow under my boots. Looking down at the world from 12,500 ft, I didn’t just feel proud. I felt free.

    <h2>The Challenge Behind the Beauty</h2> 
    <p>
     This journey was far from easy. Every step uphill demanded effort, especially in sub-zero temperatures. My body hurt, my breath shortened, and at times my mind wavered.
     But I kept reminding myself — “You are not just climbing a mountain. You are climbing a mindset.”
     What kept me going? The dream of that summit. The unwavering support of my trekking team. And the voice inside me that kept saying, “You can.”
    </p>
     <h2>Lessons the Mountains Taught Me</h2>

    <p>
      Limits are illusions — we break them by showing up, again and again.
      Preparation is everything — physical training, mental clarity, the right gear.
      Community matters — we rise by lifting each other.
      Nature heals — no therapy like sitting quietly on a snowy ridge, watching the world turn golden at sunrise.
